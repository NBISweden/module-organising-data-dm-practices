> ## About this episode 
> Research data can be organized in nearly an infinite number of different ways. When settling for a system we need to consider not only our own preferences, but also the ones we share project or data with, and how data will be preserved and reused in the future. We also need to consider that all file systems will accumulate disorder over time, and what measures we can take in order to make sure the level of disorder not becomes a problem. 


### Whom are we organizing the data for?
Humans are an organizing species. Everything we do, in everyday life as in research, is based on categorizing and systematization of information. We all recognize the benefits from keeping things in order, having an overview, and knowing where things are. It helps us being efficient in what we do, and brings a sense of relief and security not having to search for things we need. However, we also know there are different ways to interpret the quality of data organization. What makes sense to me may be nearly incomprehensible to someone else, and vice versa.

When doing research we need to consider data organization from both the individual researchers perspective as well as from the research community perspective. As individuals, we want to organize a file system so that it makes sense to us. After all, we are the ones that will work with the data on a daily basis. At the same time we may be part of a larger group where data is shared among several researchers. Even further, the data end point is not the individual, the group, or even present day, but unknown researchers reusing our data in a yet-to-be future. 

Thus, we need to settle for a file structure and data organization process that works for us in both the short and long term, while also being viable in the future. 

### Order vs. disorder
The perfect file system does not exist. No matter the intention or effort, all file systems tend to accumulate a certain level of disorder over time. Good file system management is better focused on practices decreasing the level of disorder than eliminating it completely. Managing a file system does not by necessity require a lot of time. By selecting a manageable interval for file system maintanance we can optimize effort vs. gain. Regular scheduled maintanance over a project life span can achieve more and require less time in total, than a single effort when the project is in an end phase.

Having a well defined idea of our intended file system prior to beginning data collection can have substantial impact on the time required for file system maintainance later in a project. Starting data collection without such an idea can require a major effort by the time the project ends.

## Etherpad exercise 1
Rank the following data organization steps from 1-5 (1 being the one you believe is most important, and 5 the least). Also mark with an "X" the steps you have implemented in your own research. 

- File naming convention
- Folder naming convention
- File versioning system
- File system documentation
- File and folder maintanance (deleting)


## Etherpad exercise 2
Knowing we never keep everything in perfect order, and that all file systems are flawed, what measures can we take in order to establish and maintain a file system over time? Consider issues that might be associated with short, middle, and long-term file system management.
